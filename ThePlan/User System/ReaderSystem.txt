⭐ USER ROADMAP (Reader Role)
1. Library (Book Collection)
This is the first real feature users interact with.
Blueprint: users
Model: Library (user_id, book_id)
Routes:
- POST /users/me/library
Add a book to the user’s library.
- GET /users/me/library
View the user’s library.
- DELETE /users/me/library/<book_id> (optional)
Remove a book from the library.
Why this matters:
Users must own a book before they can create playlists for it.

2. Playlists (for books in their library)
Once a user has a book, they can create playlists for it.
Blueprint: playlists
Models:
- Playlist (id, user_id, book_id, title, description)
- PlaylistSong (playlist_id, song_id, order)
Routes:
- POST /playlists
Create a playlist for a book in the user’s library.
- GET /playlists/<id>
View a playlist.
- PUT /playlists/<id>
Update playlist details.
- DELETE /playlists/<id>
Delete playlist.
- POST /playlists/<id>/songs
Add a song to a playlist.
- DELETE /playlists/<id>/songs/<song_id>
Remove a song.
Why this matters:
This is the core of your app — the “playlist for a book” experience.

3. Search (Books, Songs, Authors)
These are discovery features.
Blueprints:
- books
- songs
- authors
Routes:
- GET /books/search
- GET /books/<id>
- GET /songs/search
- GET /authors/search
- GET /authors/<id>
Why this matters:
Users need to find books → add to library → create playlists.

4. Apply for Author Role
This is how a user becomes an author.
Blueprint: users or authors
Model: AuthorApplication (user_id, status, notes)
Route:
- POST /users/apply-author
Why this matters:
This is the bridge between Reader → Author.

5. View Profiles
Users should be able to view:
- their own profile
- other users’ profiles (especially authors)
Blueprint: users
Routes:
- GET /users/me (already done in auth)
- GET /users/<id>
Why this matters:
Playlists, authors, and contributors all link back to user profiles.
