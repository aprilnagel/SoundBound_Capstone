🛡️ Admin Workflow (MVP)
Admins are special users with the ability to review and approve author verification requests. They do not manage books, playlists, or users beyond this single responsibility.

1. Admin Logs In
Admins authenticate exactly like any other user.
Flow:
- Admin logs in
- Backend recognizes role = admin
- Admin sees an “Admin Panel” link or section

2. View Pending Author Verification Requests
Admins need to see which users have requested verification.
Flow:
- Admin opens “Author Verification Requests”
- Backend returns a list of pending requests, each containing:
- user name
- pen name
- submitted proof/links
- date submitted

3. Review a Verification Request
Admins inspect the details to confirm legitimacy.
Flow:
- Admin selects a request
- Admin views:
- user info
- proof provided
- any notes
- Admin decides whether the user is a real author

4. Approve or Deny
This is the admin’s only real action.
Flow:
- Admin clicks Approve or Deny
- Backend updates:
- If approved → user.role = “author”
- If denied → request marked as denied
- User receives a notification (email or in‑app)

5. Admin Done
Admins have no other responsibilities in the MVP.
They do not:
- edit books
- delete playlists
- manage users
- moderate content
- upload covers
- manage tags
- manage system settings
Your admin role is intentionally tiny and focused.
