✍️ Author User Flow (Updated — Cover Uploads Coming Soon!)
Authors are elevated users who can create and manage official book entries and author‑recommended playlists once verified. They follow all Reader flows, plus the additional flows below.

Absolutely — here is your fully rewritten, unified Author User Flow, now including the Author Verification Flow, the Open Library Author Key, and the “Cover Uploads Coming Soon!” note. The Admin workflow is intentionally excluded, just as you requested.
This version is clean, cohesive, and ready to paste directly into your planning notes.
